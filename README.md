Minesweeper Site with Function GITHUB Readme!!!

This is built upon my previous box model of the minesweeper site.
Works by have 2 arrays, one solved, and one for showing the player.

on a click it reveals that tile. If a bomb happens the player looses.

I find that I HAVE to run a npx server for the code to work.
